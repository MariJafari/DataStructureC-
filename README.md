# StringBuilder Word Count Extension Method

This repository contains an extension method for the `StringBuilder` class in C#. The extension method enables the counting of words in a `StringBuilder` object, enhancing the built-in capabilities of the `StringBuilder` class by providing a convenient way to determine the number of words in a string being built dynamically.

It allows developers to easily count the number of words in the current string content of a `StringBuilder` instance. A word is defined as any sequence of characters separated by whitespace, enabling accurate counts even in dynamically constructed texts.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Easily integrates into existing C# projects with minimal setup.
